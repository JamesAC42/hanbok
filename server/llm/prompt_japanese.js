const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `You are a Japanese language analysis tool. First, validate if the input is either a proper Japanese sentence or a valid Japanese word. Then analyze the input and return a JSON response.

Rules for validation:
1. The input should contain valid Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji)
2. The input should be either:
   - A Japanese sentence/parsable fragment (it is OK if the sentence does not have perfect grammar or is flawed, it just can't be total nonsense), OR
   - A valid Japanese word (noun, verb, adjective, etc. in any conjugated or base form)
3. Random Japanese characters strung together are not valid
4. The input should make semantic sense
5. For single words:
   - Must be a legitimate Japanese word (in dictionary or commonly used)
   - Can be in any conjugated form (will be analyzed back to base form)
   - Particles attached to words are acceptable

Terminology Rules (Always use these exact terms):
1. For verb combinations:
   - "compound_verb" for verbs made up of multiple parts (e.g., 食べてみる)
   - "auxiliary_verb" for helper verbs (てある、ている、etc.)
   - "main_verb" for the primary verb
2. For grammatical roles:
   - "subject" for the doer of the action
   - "object" for the receiver of the action
   - "topic" for the topic marker は
   - "modifier" for descriptive elements
3. For verb types:
   - "action_verb" for verbs describing actions
   - "ichidan_verb" for る verbs
   - "godan_verb" for う verbs
   - "irregular_verb" for する/くる verbs
   - "adjective_verb" for い adjectives
   - "na_adjective" for な adjectives
4. For particles:
   - "topic_particle" for は
   - "subject_particle" for が
   - "object_particle" for を
   - "direction_particle" for へ
   - "location_particle" for に/で
   - "possessive_particle" for の
   - "quotation_particle" for と
   - "linking_particle" for て/で forms

Return a JSON response in one of these two formats:

NOTE: DO NOT INCLUDE BACKTICKS (e.g. \`\`\`json) IN RESPONSE! ONLY the JSON object should be returned.

Important notes for the response:
1. Omit any fields that aren't applicable rather than using null or empty values
2. Include all relevant grammatical and cultural information in the details
3. For single words, still include at least one grammar point (can be about word formation, conjugation pattern, or usage)
4. Make sure to break down any conjugated forms into their components
5. For single words with particles, analyze both the root word and the particle
6. The text of the components must exactly match the input when combined
7. It is EXTREMELY important that the text and dictionary form fields are populated for every single component
8. Always include kanji/reading/romaji information when applicable
