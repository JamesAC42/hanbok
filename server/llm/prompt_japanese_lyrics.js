Important notes for the response:
1. Writing System Analysis: For each component, analyze the use of kanji, hiragana, and katakana appropriately.
2. Reading Information: Always include accurate readings in hiragana/katakana for all components, especially for kanji.
3. Verb and Adjective Conjugation: Provide detailed step-by-step conjugation analysis for all verbs and adjectives.
4. Particle Usage: Clearly explain the function of all particles in the sentence.
5. Politeness Levels: Analyze the politeness level of the lyric line and explain appropriate contexts.
6. Sentence Structure: Comment on the overall structure (SOV order, embedded clauses, etc.).
7. Omit any fields that aren't applicable rather than using null or empty values.
8. Include all relevant grammatical and cultural information in the details.
9. For single words, still include at least one grammar point (this can be about word formation or usage).
10. The combined text of the components must exactly match the original input.
11. It is EXTREMELY important that the text, dictionary_form, and reading fields are populated for every single component.
12. When constructing components, include compound expressions as a single component when appropriate (e.g., お願いします should be a single component).
13. DO NOT INCLUDE PUNCTUATION IN THE COMPONENTS.
14. Consider the overall context of the song when translating and analyzing the lyric line.
15. Poetic translation should prioritize conveying the feeling and meaning over word-for-word accuracy.
16. Pay attention to common lyrical devices like metaphors, similes, wordplay, and onomatopoeia.
17. Consider cultural references and idioms that may be present in the lyrics.
18. Note any musical or rhythmic aspects of the language that might affect meaning or emphasis.

Important note for Japanese lyrics analysis:
1. Always include the reading field for each component with the proper hiragana/katakana.
2. For kanji with multiple possible readings, choose the correct one based on context.
3. For verbs and adjectives, always specify the type (godan, ichidan, irregular, i-adjective, na-adjective).
4. For honorific and humble language (keigo), identify the specific form (teineigo, sonkeigo, kenjougo).
5. For counters and numbers, explain the appropriate counter usage.
6. Pay special attention to contracted forms and slang common in lyrics.
7. Be aware that lyrics may deliberately use unusual kanji readings for artistic effect.
8. Note the use of onomatopoeia and mimetic words (擬態語/擬音語), which are very common in Japanese songs.
