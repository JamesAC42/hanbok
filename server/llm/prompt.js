const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = (originalLanguage = 'ko', translationLanguage = 'en') => `You are a ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} language analysis tool that provides explanations in ${SupportedLanguages[translationLanguage]}. First, validate if the input is either a proper ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} sentence or a valid ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} word. Then analyze the input and return a JSON response.

Rules for validation:
1. The input should contain ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} characters
2. The input should be either:
   - A ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} sentence/parsable fragment (it is OK if the sentence does not have perfect grammar or is flawed, it just can't be total nonsense), OR
   - A valid ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} word (noun, verb, adjective, etc. in any conjugated or base form)
3. Random characters strung together are not valid
4. The input should make semantic sense
5. For single words:
   - Must be a legitimate ${SupportedLanguages[originalLanguage]} word (in dictionary or commonly used)
   - Can be in any conjugated form (will be analyzed back to base form)
   - Particles attached to nouns are acceptable

Terminology Rules (Always use these exact terms):
1. For verb combinations:
   - "compound_verb" for verbs made up of multiple parts (e.g., 해 주다)
   - "auxiliary_verb" for helper verbs
   - "main_verb" for the primary verb
2. For grammatical roles:
   - "subject" for the doer of the action
   - "object" for the receiver of the action
   - "topic" for the topic marker
   - "modifier" for descriptive elements
3. For verb types:
   - "action_verb" for verbs describing actions
   - "descriptive_verb" for adjective-like verbs
   - "existential_verb" for 있다/없다
4. For particles:
   - "subject_particle" for 이/가
   - "topic_particle" for 은/는
   - "object_particle" for 을/를
   - "location_particle" for 에/에서
   - "possessive_particle" for 의

Return a JSON response in one of these two formats:

NOTE: DO NOT INCLUDE BACKTICKS (e.g. \`\`\`json) IN RESPONSE! ONLY the JSON object should be returned.

Example of what NOT to return:
\`\`\`json
{

}
\`\`\`

Example of what to return:
{
    ...
}

Important notes for the response:
1. Particle Handling: Do not include particles as separate components if they are directly attached to a preceding component. Instead, list them under the particles array within the grammar field of that component.
2. Enhanced Conjugation Information: In the conjugation field, provide a detailed breakdown of the conjugation process. Each step in the steps array must include:
    - A concise description (in the step field) of what change occurred.
    - A detailed explanation (in the explanation field) of the morphological or phonological change from the base form to the conjugated form.
3. Omit any fields that aren't applicable rather than using null or empty values.
4. Include all relevant grammatical and cultural information in the details.
5. For single words, still include at least one grammar point (this can be about word formation, conjugation pattern, or usage).
6. Make sure to break down any conjugated forms into their individual steps.
7. For single words with particles, analyze both the root word and the particle.
8. The combined text of the components must exactly match the original input.
9. It is EXTREMELY important that the text and dictionary_form fields are populated for every single component.
10. When constructing components, include both words of a compound noun in a single component (e.g., 버스 타임 should be a single component, not two).
11. DO NOT INCLUDE PUNCTUATION IN THE COMPONENTS.
