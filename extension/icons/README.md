# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels - Used in the extension toolbar
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels - Used in extension management 
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels - Used in the Chrome Web Store
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels - Used in the Chrome Web Store and extension details

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG format
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color
- **Design**: Should represent the Kankoku language learning brand
- **Colors**: Should use the brand colors (blue #3b82f6 and complementary colors)

## Suggested Design Elements

- Korean/language learning symbols
- Book or study-related imagery
- Clean, modern design that works at small sizes
- Consistent with the web application's branding

## How to Add Icons

1. Create or obtain the icon files in the required sizes
2. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames listed above
3. The manifest.json file is already configured to use these icons

For now, the extension will work without icons, but browsers may show default placeholder icons until proper icon files are added.
